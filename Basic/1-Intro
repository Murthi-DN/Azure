What is Cloud?

	* Cloud is a server that is accessed over the Internet, and the software and databases that run on those servers

	* Cloud servers are located in data centers all over the world

	* By using cloud computing, users and companies do not have to manage physical servers themselves or run software applications on their own machines

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is Cloud Computing?

	* Is a use of Hardware and Software components to deliver a service to a Network

	* Users can access file and applications from any device that can access Internet

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CapEx (Capital Expense)

	Initial Investment for Data Center
	Ex: Data Centers by Providers

OpEx (Operating Expense)

	Pay for what we use on ongoing process, or operational time expense
	Ex: What we use by paying, everything available, just use it

Cloud Services:

IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)

	* Cloud provides underlying platform, ex: Compute, Networking, Storage

	* Client is responsible for handling infra

	* Ex: Virtual Machines


PaaS (Platform as a Service)

	* Cloud provides platform for running apps

	* Gives Compute, Networking, Storage, RunTime Environment

	* User just need to bring Code

	* Ex: Web Apps

	* Client has no access to underlying machines


SaaS (Software as a Service)

	* Software running on cloud

	* User doesn't need to install Run Time Environment

	* Ex: Gmail, Office 365 - We have no idea of it's infra, language used to develop, database. We just use it

	* We have no access to infra

Types of Cloud:

1. Public Cloud:

	* Cloud is set up in the public network

	* Managed by large companies

	* Accesible through internet

	* Accesible to all clients

	* Client has no access to underlying infrastructure

	Ex: AWS, Azure, GCP


2. Private Cloud
	
	* Cloud is set up in orgranization's premises

	* Managed by orgranization's IT team

	* Accessible only orgranization's network

	* Avaiable to users from orgranization

	* Unauthenticated or External users don't have access to it

	* Uses private cloud infrastructure

	* Mainly we use it bcz of security reasons, we don't want to expose them to public

	* Ex: VM Ware Cloud, RedHat OpenShift, Azure Stack


3. Hybrid Cloud

	* Set up in an orgranization's premises but also connected to Public cloud

	* Workload can be separated between 2 clouds

	* Ex: Sensitive Data in orgranization premises and public data in public cloud

	* LinkedIn: Username and Paswords can be stored in private cloud, users profiles can be stored in public cloud 

	* Ex: Azure Arc, AWS outposts
