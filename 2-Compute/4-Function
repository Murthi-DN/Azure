* Small Function runs as a Result of an Event
* Response something when something happens in system
* Automatically managed by Azure
* Serverless

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Serverless:

* Cloud resource managed by Azure
* User don't need to think about CPU, Memory, VM...etc

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Triggerd and Binding:

* Triggers trigger the Function on some event occur
* Binding means, connection between Function and Other Resources where it reads or writes

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cold Start:
	
* Since Azure is taking care, if function service goes down, need few time to come up

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Durable Function:
	
* Stateful functions that interact with external resources and keep track of flow
* Good function chaining, means o/p of a function goes to i/p of another function
