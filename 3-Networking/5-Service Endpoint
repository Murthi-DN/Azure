"Lot of Resources can have Public IP and not in VNET" - Security Risk

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Let's say a Resource in a VNET wants to talk to a Resource which is not in VNET, and that external one has Public IP

* So VNET Resource has to Resource to Internet and then gets connected to External Resource

* Security Risk comes

* So Service Endpoint comes!!!

* If i create a Service Endpoint for that External Resource, my VNET Resource can directly talk to External Resource with going to Public Internet
